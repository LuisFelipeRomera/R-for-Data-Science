# Two dimensional dispersion graph

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   In this exercise, i'm going to do a two dimensional dispersion graph to visualize the relationship between **highway miles per gallon** x **engine displacement** x **class** from the cars present in the dataframe *mpg*, native to *TidyVerse* library.

-   I'll be using the function `ggplot`, from the package **GGPlot2**.

-   In my graph, **highway miles per gallon** **(hwy)** will be represented by the y axis, **engine displacement (displ)** by the x axis and the **class** by the color of the points.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```
